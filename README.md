# GAIA 
Generative Design Identity patterns for ValueLabs Design Inspire Conference 2021

## Concept
The concept presented here is eponymous to GAIA (also pronounced Gaea /ˈdʒiːə), the mythical goddess of Earth, one of the elemental deities born at the dawn of creation. She represents the driving force that nurtures life through the interaction of both living and non-living beings. This legend has been interpreted as a very unique and intriguing phenomenon by historians and philosophers for ages. 

Based on these interpretations, we affirm that however unique, every entity on this planet is a manifestation of the same continuous process of regeneration and evolution with time. This concept is most visible in the Anthropocene era; humans have changed Earth in unprecedented ways and are now beginning to experience the effects of these changes upon themselves.

This essence was translated into the underlying concept of our artworks; random parameters that share the same visual elements and use participant profiles to generate a unique pattern for each participant of the Design Inspire 2021 Conference. They denote that although quite different from one another, we are all connected in spirit and possess the capability to change ourselves and our planet for the better or worse.
